# GrapphSpaces_PublicGraphs

I used python2.7 to write the python code.

There are two ways to update the data:
(1)	Run “dataFilte.py” manually.
(2)	Run “timer.py” which update the data in every 200 second automatically. 

Please open index.html on IE internet browser to see the result.

Total number of public graph in GraphSpace can be found in “TotalNumberOfPublicGraphs.csv”.
